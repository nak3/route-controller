    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # ***** WARNING *****
    # This configuration is tentative.
    # The structure of this configmap might be changed in the future version.
